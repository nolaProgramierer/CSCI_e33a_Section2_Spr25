# Tuples
# A tuple is sequence of values, of any type, that are immutable
# Tuples are written with round brackets.
# Immutability, faster that lists, multiple return values, 
# protect data from modification


print("1)")
# Instantiate a tuple


print()
print("2)")
# Tuples are hashable, and as such can be used as dictionary keys


print()
print("3)")
# Swap values without a temporary variable


print()
print("4)")
# Tuples are useful for grouping related data, 
# such as representing a point (x, y) in 2D space.


# Packing & Unpacking

# Packing in Python generally refers to collecting multiple values 
# into a single variable, typically using tuples, lists, or 
# dictionaries. This is useful for various operations like 
# returning multiple values from a function or passing a 
# variable number of arguments to a function.
print()
print("5)")
# Packing position arguments
def display_piano_details(brand, finish, price):
    print(f"Brand: {brand}, Finish: {finish}, Price: ${price}")


print()
print("6)")
# Packing keyword arguments
def display_piano_details(brand, finish, price):
    print(f"Brand: {brand}, Finish: {finish}, Price: ${price}")


print()
print("7)")
#Sum a tuple
t3 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
